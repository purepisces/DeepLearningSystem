### LayerNorm1d

`needle.nn.LayerNorm1d(dim, eps=1e-5, device=None, dtype="float32")`

Applies layer normalization over a mini-batch of inputs as described in the paper [Layer Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450).

$$y = w \circ \frac{x_i - \textbf{E}[x]}{((\textbf{Var}[x]+\epsilon)^{1/2})} + b$$
  
where $\textbf{E}[x]$ denotes the empirical mean of the inputs, $\textbf{Var}[x]$ denotes their empirical variance (note that here we are using the "biased" estimate of the variance, i.e., dividing by $N$ rather than by $N-1$), and $w$ and $b$ denote learnable scalar weights and biases respectively. Note you can assume the input to this layer is a 2D tensor, with batches in the first dimension and features in the second. You might need to broadcast the weight and bias before applying them.

##### Parameters

- `dim` - number of channels

- `eps` - a value added to the denominator for numerical stability.

  

##### Variables

- `weight` - the learnable weights of size `dim`, elements initialized to 1.

- `bias` - the learnable bias of shape `dim`, elements initialized to 0.

in the `LayerNorm1d` class, `self.dim` is intended to represent the `feature_size`, which is the number of features in each input tensor `x`.

### Explanation for LayerNorm1d

`LayerNorm1d` is implemented in this way to provide stable and effective feature normalization across the input features for each sample in the batch. In the LayerNorm1d implementation, each row (which corresponds to an individual input example) will have the same mean subtracted from all its elements, and it will be divided by the same variance. Specifically:

-   For each input example (each row in the tensor), the mean is computed across all the features in that row.
-   The same mean is then subtracted from each feature in that row.
-   The variance is also computed across all the features in that row.
-   Each feature in the row is divided by the same variance (after adding the small epsilon for numerical stability).

This means that all features within a single example (row) are normalized using the same mean and variance, ensuring that each feature in the example is standardized relative to the others in the same row. This helps the model to focus on the relationships between features within each example, rather than being influenced by the absolute values of those features.

####  Why This Matters:

-   **Without Normalization:** The model could be biased towards features with larger values, interpreting them as more significant purely based on their magnitude.
-   **With Normalization:** The model treats all features on a more equal footing, focusing more on the relationships between features (such as how they differ from the mean) rather than their raw magnitudes.
### Difference Between LayerNorm1d and BatchNorm

While `LayerNorm1d` normalizes features within each individual sample (row) in the batch, `BatchNorm` normalizes features across all samples in the batch. Here's how they differ:

-   **LayerNorm1d**:
    
    -   Normalizes each feature within a single sample (row).
    -   The mean and variance are computed across the features in each individual sample.
    -   It ensures that each feature in a sample is standardized relative to other features in that same sample.
    -   Used primarily when the relationships between features within each sample are critical, such as in NLP tasks or RNNs.
-   **BatchNorm**:
    
    -   Normalizes each feature across all samples in the batch.
    -   The mean and variance are computed across the batch for each feature (column).
    -   It ensures that each feature has a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 across the entire batch.
    -   Commonly used in deep CNNs to stabilize and accelerate training by normalizing the input to each layer.

In summary, `LayerNorm1d` focuses on normalizing the internal relationships within each sample, while `BatchNorm` focuses on normalizing the distribution of each feature across the batch. These different approaches make `LayerNorm1d` more suitable for tasks where the internal structure of each sample is important, whereas `BatchNorm` is better for tasks where consistent feature scaling across the batch is beneficial.

### Explanation of $\textbf{E}[x]$

$\textbf{E}[x]$ represents the expected value (or mean) of the random variable $x$. In the context of the implementation and in many statistical applications, $\textbf{E}[x]$ is often used to denote the mean or average value of $x$.

So, in the formula:


$$ \textbf{E}[x] = \mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i$$

$\mu$ is the mean (or expected value) of the features, calculated as the sum of all feature values $x_i$ divided by the total number of features $N$.

### Explanation of $\textbf{Var}[x]$

The formula for variance ($\textbf{Var}[x]$) in the context of layer normalization is as follows:

$$\textbf{Var}[x] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - E(x))^2$$

Where:

- $x_i$ is the input feature.
- $\mu$ is the mean of the input features (calculated across the features axis).
- $N$ is the number of features.

In the context of your implementation for `LayerNorm1d`, the variance is computed as:

1. **Compute the mean** $\mu$ across the features for each sample in the batch.
2. **Subtract the mean** from each feature value $x_i$ to get the deviation: $x_i - \mu$.
3. **Square** the deviation: $(x_i - \mu)^2$.
4. **Sum** the squared deviations across the features.
5. **Divide** by the number of features $N$ to get the variance.

So, the variance formula applied in code would be:

$$\text{var} = \frac{1}{\text{features}} \sum_{i=1}^{\text{features}} (x_i - \text{mean})^2$$

Code:
```python
x_minus_mean = x - broadcast_mean
var = ops.divide_scalar(ops.summation(x_minus_mean ** 2, axes=(1,)), features)
```

### An additional Explanation of reshape(-1,1)
`(-1, 1)` can be used to reshape tensors of various dimensions, not just 1D tensors. The key idea behind using `-1` is that it allows the reshape operation to infer the size of that dimension based on the number of elements in the original tensor and the specified size of the other dimensions.

#### How `(-1, 1)` Works:

-   **`-1`**: This dimension is automatically determined by the reshape operation. It calculates how many elements are needed to fill the new shape given the size of the other dimensions.
-   **`1`**: This explicitly sets the dimension to 1, turning the reshaped tensor into a column vector for that dimension.

#### Examples with Different Dimensions:

##### Example 1: Reshape a 1D Tensor to a 2D Column Vector
```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])  # Shape: (6,)
reshaped_a = np.reshape(a, (-1, 1))  # Shape: (6, 1)
```
This reshapes the 1D tensor with 6 elements into a 2D tensor with 6 rows and 1 column.

##### Example 2: Reshape a 2D Tensor to Another 2D Tensor
```python
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])  # Shape: (2, 3)
reshaped_a = np.reshape(a, (-1, 1))   # Shape: (6, 1)
```
Here, the 2D tensor with shape `(2, 3)` is reshaped into a 2D tensor with 6 rows and 1 column.

##### Example 3: Reshape a 3D Tensor to a 2D Tensor
```python
a = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])  # Shape: (2, 2, 2)
reshaped_a = np.reshape(a, (-1, 1))  # Shape: (8, 1)
```
In this case, the 3D tensor with shape `(2, 2, 2)` is flattened and reshaped into a 2D tensor with 8 rows.

#### Whole Example
```python
sums = ops.summation(x, axes=1)
mean = ops.divide_scalar(sums, features)
tmp = ops.reshape(mean, (-1, 1))
broadcast_mean = ops.broadcast_to(tmp, x.shape)
```
### Example Tensor `x`:

Let's assume `x` is a 2D tensor (matrix) with shape `(3, 4)`:

```python
import numpy as np
#Example tensor `x` with shape (3, 4)
x = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4],
              [5, 6, 7, 8],
              [9, 10, 11, 12]])

print("Tensor x:")
print(x)

Tensor x:
[[ 1  2  3  4]
 [ 5  6  7  8]
 [ 9 10 11 12]]
sums = ops.summation(x, axes=1)
sums = np.sum(x, axis=1)
print("Summation across axis 1:", sums)
Summation across axis 1: [10 26 42]
mean = ops.divide_scalar(sums, features)
mean = sums / 4
print("Mean of each row:", mean)
Mean of each row: [ 2.5  6.5 10.5]
tmp = ops.reshape(mean, (-1, 1))
tmp = mean.reshape(-1, 1)
print("Reshaped mean (column vector):")
print(tmp)
Reshaped mean (column vector):
[[ 2.5]
 [ 6.5]
 [10.5]]
broadcast_mean = ops.broadcast_to(tmp, x.shape)
broadcast_mean = np.broadcast_to(tmp, x.shape)
print("Broadcasted mean:")
print(broadcast_mean)
Broadcasted mean:
[[ 2.5  2.5  2.5  2.5]
 [ 6.5  6.5  6.5  6.5]
 [10.5 10.5 10.5 10.5]]

### Flatten

`needle.nn.Flatten()`

  

Takes in a tensor of shape `(B,X_0,X_1,...)`, and flattens all non-batch dimensions so that the output is of shape `(B, X_0 * X_1 * ...)`

Code Implementation:
```python
class Flatten(Module):
    def forward(self, X):
        ### BEGIN YOUR SOLUTION
        batch_size = X.shape[0]
        flattened_shape = (batch_size, -1)
        return X.reshape(flattened_shape)

### Explanation of `Flatten` module
The explanation describes what the `Flatten` module does in terms of transforming the shape of a tensor. Let's break it down with an example:

### What Does Flatten Do?

When we talk about a tensor with shape `(B, X_0, X_1, ...)`, it means:

-   **`B`**: The batch size, which is the number of examples in the batch.
-   **`X_0, X_1, ...`**: The dimensions of each example in the batch.

The `Flatten` operation transforms the tensor by flattening all dimensions except the batch size. This means it combines all the non-batch dimensions into a single dimension.

### Example 1: Flattening a 3D Tensor

Let's say we have a tensor with the shape `(2, 3, 4)`:

-   **Batch size (`B`)**: 2
-   **Other dimensions (`X_0`, `X_1`)**: 3 and 4

The tensor might look like this (simplified):
```python
[
  [[a, b, c, d],   # First example
   [e, f, g, h],
   [i, j, k, l]],

  [[m, n, o, p],   # Second example
   [q, r, s, t],
   [u, v, w, x]]
]
```
Here, we have:

-   2 examples (the outermost list)
-   Each example is a 3x4 matrix.

**Flattening** this tensor means we combine the 3 and 4 dimensions into one, making each example a single vector of 12 elements.

So, after flattening, the shape of the tensor will be `(2, 12)`:
```python
[
  [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l],  # First example
  [m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x]   # Second example
]
```
### Example 2: Flattening a 4D Tensor

Consider a tensor with the shape `(2, 3, 4, 5)`:

-   **Batch size (`B`)**: 2
-   **Other dimensions (`X_0`, `X_1`, `X_2`)**: 3, 4, and 5

This tensor could represent 2 examples where each example is a 3D object with dimensions 3x4x5.

Flattening this tensor would combine the dimensions 3, 4, and 5 into one, giving the resulting shape `(2, 60)`:
```python
[
  [a1, a2, ..., a60],  # First example
  [b1, b2, ..., b60]   # Second example
]
```
### Summary

-   The **Flatten** operation keeps the batch size the same.
-   It combines all other dimensions into a single dimension, making each example a long vector.
-   The result is useful in neural networks where you want to pass a multi-dimensional input (like an image) into a fully connected layer that expects a flat vector as input.

### Explanation of X.reshape((batch_size, -1))

-   **`X`**: This is a tensor or a multi-dimensional array.
-   **`batch_size`**: This represents the number of examples or samples in a batch. Typically, this is the first dimension of your tensor.
-   **`-1`**: This is a special value in reshaping operations that tells the reshaping function to automatically calculate the size of this dimension based on the remaining dimensions and the total number of elements in the tensor.

### BatchNorm1d

`needle.nn.BatchNorm1d(dim, eps=1e-5, momentum=0.1, device=None, dtype="float32")`

Applies batch normalization over a mini-batch of inputs as described in the paper [Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167).

$$y = w \circ \frac{z_i - \textbf{E}[x]}{((\textbf{Var}[x]+\epsilon)^{1/2})} + b$$
  
but where here the mean and variance refer to to the mean and variance over the _batch_dimensions. The function also computes a running average of mean/variance for all features at each layer $\hat{\mu}, \hat{\sigma}^2$, and at test time normalizes by these quantities:

$$y = \frac{(x - \hat{mu})}{((\hat{\sigma}^2_{i+1})_j+\epsilon)^{1/2}}$$

BatchNorm uses the running estimates of mean and variance instead of batch statistics at test time, i.e.,

after `model.eval()` has been called on the BatchNorm layer's `training` flag is false.

 
To compute the running estimates, you can use the equation $$\hat{x_{new}} = (1 - m) \hat{x_{old}} + mx_{observed},$$

where $m$ is momentum.

##### Parameters

- `bias` - the learnable bias of size `dim`, elements initialized to 0.

- `running_var` - the running (unbiased) variance used at evaluation time, elements initialized to 1.

### Normalize the input $\frac{z_i - \textbf{E}[x]}{((\textbf{Var}[x]+\epsilon)^{1/2})}$ 

The term $\frac{z_i - \textbf{E}[x]}{((\textbf{Var}[x]+\epsilon)^{1/2})}$ normalizes the input $z_i$​ by centering it (subtracting the mean) and scaling it (dividing by the standard deviation, which is the square root of the variance plus epsilon). This process results in a normalized feature with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1, often denoted as $\hat{x}$ or $\hat{z_i}$​.
### Explanation for  Running estimates

Running estimates in the context of Batch Normalization refer to the continuously updated averages of the mean and variance of the features, which are computed over multiple mini-batches during training.

#### Running Mean and Running Variance

-   **Running Mean ($\hat{\mu}$​)**: This is an estimate of the average value of each feature across all the training data. Instead of recalculating the mean from scratch for every mini-batch, the running mean is updated incrementally using the mean of each new mini-batch. This allows the model to have a stable estimate of the mean even when the data is divided into smaller batches.
    
-   **Running Variance ($\hat{\sigma}^2$)**: This is an estimate of the variance of each feature across all the training data. Like the running mean, the running variance is updated incrementally using the variance calculated from each new mini-batch.
    

#### How Running Estimates Work

During training, for each mini-batch, the mean and variance are calculated for the features in that mini-batch. The running estimates (mean and variance) are then updated as follows:

-   **Running Mean Update**:
  
$$\hat{\mu}{\text{new}} = (1 - m) \cdot \hat{\mu}{\text{old}} + m \cdot \mu_{\text{batch}}$$
    
-   **Running Variance Update**:
  
$$\hat{\sigma}^2_{\text{new}} = (1 - m) \cdot \hat{\sigma}^2_{\text{old}} + m \cdot \sigma^2_{\text{batch}}$$
    

Where:

-   $\hat{\mu}{\text{old}}$ and $\hat{\sigma}^2_{\text{old}}$ are the previous running estimates.
-   $\mu_{\text{batch}}$ and $\sigma^2_{\text{batch}}$​ are the mean and variance computed from the current mini-batch.
-   $m$ is the momentum, controlling how much of the current batch's statistics influence the running estimates.

#### Why Running Estimates Are Important

-   **Training Phase**: During training, the batch statistics (mean and variance of the current mini-batch) are used to normalize the data. At the same time, the running estimates are updated to reflect the current data distribution.
    
-   **Inference Phase**: When the model is in inference (evaluation) mode, batch statistics are not available because data is usually processed one sample at a time. Instead of using batch statistics, the model uses the running estimates of mean and variance to normalize the data. This ensures that the model can generalize well on new data, using the learned statistics from training.

In summary, running estimates provide a way to capture the global statistics of the data during training and apply them during inference, enabling the model to function consistently across both phases.

### Why Use Running Mean and Variance in Evaluation Mode?

1.  **Stability and Consistency**:
    
    -   During evaluation (or inference), the model needs to behave consistently, regardless of the specific inputs. If we were to compute the mean and variance on-the-fly during evaluation (like we do during training), the output could vary significantly depending on the specific batch of data being processed at that moment. This would make the model's predictions unstable.
    -   The running mean and variance are accumulated during training and represent a stable estimate of the mean and variance across the entire training data (or a large portion of it). Using these running estimates during evaluation ensures that the network's behavior is consistent and does not depend on the specific batch of data being processed at inference time.
2.  **Non-dependence on Batch Size**:
    
    -   At evaluation time, the batch size might be different from what was used during training (e.g., you might process one sample at a time). If we were to compute the batch statistics on-the-fly in evaluation mode, the model's performance could degrade because the batch statistics computed on a single sample (or a small batch) would not be representative of the overall data distribution.
    -   By using the running mean and variance, which are computed over many batches during training, we avoid this issue and ensure that the network's output remains robust.

### Why Calculate Batch Statistics During Training but Not Use Running Estimates?

1.  **Capturing the Data Distribution**:
    
    -   During training, the goal is to learn the parameters of the model (including the weights and biases of the BatchNorm layer) that work well with the data distribution. To do this, it's important to normalize the data based on the statistics of the current mini-batch. This allows the model to adapt to the actual distribution of the data it sees during training.
    -   Batch statistics (mean and variance) computed during each mini-batch are a good approximation of the data distribution within that mini-batch, and using them helps the model learn more effectively.
    
2.  **Avoiding Overfitting to Specific Batches**:
    
    -   If we were to use the running mean and variance during training instead of the batch statistics, the model might overfit to the running estimates, which are based on previous batches. This would reduce the regularization effect provided by BatchNorm, which comes from the slight noise introduced by normalizing with batch-specific statistics.
    -   By normalizing with the statistics of the current batch, BatchNorm introduces some noise that acts as a regularizer, helping to prevent overfitting.

### Summary:

-   **Training Mode**: BatchNorm normalizes the data using the batch-specific mean and variance because this allows the model to learn effectively, adapting to the distribution of the data it sees during training. During this process, the running mean and variance are updated to accumulate stable estimates that will be used during evaluation.
    
-   **Evaluation Mode**: BatchNorm uses the running mean and variance to ensure consistent and stable performance across different inputs, regardless of the batch size or data distribution. This helps to maintain the model's predictive accuracy and stability when it's deployed in the real world.
    

### Explanation of the Momentum in BatchNorm1d

In BatchNorm1d, the momentum hyperparameter controls how quickly the running estimates (mean and variance) adapt to the statistics of the current mini-batch of data. Here's a detailed explanation of how the value of momentum affects the behavior:

#### **Momentum Formula**

The running estimates for the mean $\hat{\mu}$​ and variance $\hat{\sigma}^2$ are updated using the following formula:

$$\hat{x}{\text{new}} = (1 - m) \hat{x}{\text{old}} + m \cdot x_{\text{observed}}$$

Where:

-   $\hat{x}_{\text{new}}$​ is the updated running estimate.
-   $m$ is the momentum value.
-   $\hat{x}_{\text{old}}$​ is the previous running estimate.
-   $x_{\text{observed}}$​ is the current observed statistic (mean or variance) from the mini-batch.

#### **Effect of Large Momentum $m \approx 1$**

-   **Rapid Adaptation:** When momentum is large (e.g., $m = 0.9$), the new running estimates are heavily influenced by the current batch statistics. This means that the running mean and variance will change quickly to reflect the statistics of the most recent mini-batches.
    
-   **Less Historical Influence:** The contribution of the previous running estimate $1 - m$ is small, so the running mean and variance quickly forget the statistics of earlier batches.
    
-   **Use Case:** Large momentum values are useful when the data distribution is changing rapidly, and you want the running statistics to adapt quickly to new data.

#### **Effect of Small Momentum $m \approx 0$**

-   **Slow Adaptation:** When momentum is small (e.g., $m=0.1$), the new running estimates are only slightly influenced by the current batch statistics. The running mean and variance will change slowly, making them more stable and less responsive to fluctuations in the mini-batch statistics.
    
-   **More Historical Influence:** The contribution of the previous running estimate is large, so the running mean and variance maintain a stronger influence from earlier batches.
    
-   **Use Case:** Small momentum values are useful when the data distribution is stable, and you want the running statistics to smooth out noise and avoid overreacting to temporary fluctuations in the batch statistics.

#### **Summary**

-   **Large Momentum ($m \approx 1$)**: Fast adaptation to recent batches, less influenced by historical data.
-   **Small Momentum ($m \approx 0$)**: Slow adaptation, more influenced by the history of the data, providing more stability to the running estimates.

### Key Differences For LayerNorm and BatchNorm

-   **Normalization Axis**:
    -   **LayerNorm**: Normalizes across the features within each individual example.
    -   **BatchNorm**: Normalizes across the batch for each feature.
-   **Mean and Variance Calculation**:
    -   **LayerNorm**: Calculates the mean and variance across the features of a single example.
    -   **BatchNorm**: Calculates the mean and variance across the batch for each feature.
