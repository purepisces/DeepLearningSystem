## Question 0

This homework builds off of Homework 1. First, in your Homework 2 directory, copy the files `python/needle/autograd.py`, `python/needle/ops/ops_mathematic.py` from your Homework 1.

***NOTE***: The default data type for the tensor is `float32`. If you want to change the data type, you can do so by setting the `dtype` parameter in the `Tensor` constructor. For example, `Tensor([1, 2, 3], dtype='float64')` will create a tensor with `float64` data type. 
In this homework, make sure any tensor you create has `float32` data type to avoid any issues with the autograder.
