# Deep Learning System

This repository contains a series of homework assignments for the CMU Deep Learning System course. There are 4 homework assignments in total, from hw0 to hw4.

## Homework Assignments Overview

### hw0
**I still haven't finish question 6, the c++ part.**

Hw0 includes functions to read and parse the MNIST dataset, compute softmax loss, and perform Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for both softmax regression and a simple two-layer neural network, providing a foundational framework for the MNIST digit classification problem.

Pay attention to 
- **src/simple.ml.py**

### hw1
hw1 implement reverse mode AD by extending computational graph instead of using backpropogation.
