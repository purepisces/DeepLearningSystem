The assignment will require you to build a basic softmax regression algorithm, plus a simple two-layer neural network.  You will create these implementations both in native Python (using the numpy library), and (for softmax regression) in native C/C++. 

Dataset:

The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of images of handwritten digits (0-9) and their corresponding labels. 

Structure of the MNIST Dataset
The MNIST dataset is split into two parts:

Training set: 60,000 examples
Test set: 10,000 examples
Each example in the dataset consists of:

Image: A 28x28 grayscale image of a handwritten digit.
Label: A label corresponding to the digit in the image (0-9).
