## Part 2: CPU Backend - Compact and setitem

Implement the following functions in `ndarray_backend_cpu.cc`:

* `Compact()`

* `EwiseSetitem()`

* `ScalarSetitem()`

  
To see why these are all in the same category, let's consider the implementation of the `Compact()` function. Recall that a matrix is considered compact if it is layed out sequentially in memory in "row-major" form (but really a generalization of row-many to higher dimensional arrays), i.e. with the last dimension first, followed by the second to last dimension, etc, all the way to the first. In our implementation, we also require that the total size of allocated backend array be equal to the size of the array (i.e., the underlying array also can't have any data before or after the array data, which e.g., implies that the `.offset` field equals zero).

  
Now let's consider, using a 3D array as a an example, of how a compact call might work. Here `shape` and `strides` are the shape and strides of the matrix being compacted (i.e., before we have compacted it).

  

```c++

cnt = 0;

for (size_t i = 0; i < shape[0]; i++)

for (size_t j = 0; j < shape[1]; j++)

for (size_t k = 0; k < shape[2]; k++)

out[cnt++] = in[strides[0]*i + strides[1]*j + strides[2]*k];

```

In other words, we're converting from a stride-based representation of the matrix to a purely sequential one.

  

Now, the challenge in implementing `Compact()` is that you want the method to work for any number of input dimensions. It's easy to specialize for different fixed-dimension-size arrays, but for a generic implementation, you'll want to think about how to do this same operation where you effectively want a "variable number of for loops". As a hint, one way to do this is to maintain a vector of indices (of size equal to the number of dimensions), and then manually increment them in a loop (including a "carry" operation when any of the reaches their maximum size).

  

However, if you get really stuck with this, you can alway use the fact that we're probably not going to ask you to deal with matrices of more than 6 dimensions (though we _will_ use 6 dimensions, for the im2col operation we discussed in class).


#### The connection to setitem

The setitem functionality, while seemingly quite different, is actually intimately related to `Compact()`. `__setitem()__` is the Python function called when setting some elements of the object, i.e.,

```python

A[::2,4:5,9] = 0  # or = some_other_array

```

How would you go about implementing this? In the `__getitem()__` call above, you already implemented a method to take a subset of a matrix without copying (but just modifying strides). But how would you actually go about _setting_ elements of this array? In virtually all the other settings in this homework, we call `.compact()` before setting items in an output array, but in this case it doesn't work: calling `.compact()` would copy the subset array to some new memory, but the whole point of the `__setitem__()` call is that we want to modify existing memory.

  

If you think about this for a while, you'll realize that the answer looks a lot like `.compact()` but in reverse. If we want to assign a (itself already compact) right hand side matrix to a `__getitem()__` results, then we need to here like `shape` and `stride` be those fields of the _output_ matrix. Then we could implement the setitem call as follows

  

```c++

cnt = 0;

for (size_t i = 0; i < shape[0]; i++)

for (size_t j = 0; j < shape[1]; j++)

for (size_t k = 0; k < shape[2]; k++)

out[strides[0]*i + strides[1]*j + strides[2]*k] = in[cnt++]; // or "= val;"

```

Due to this similarity, if you implement your indexing strategy in a modular fashion, you'll be able to reuse it between the `Compact()` call and the `EwiseSetitem()` and `ScalarSetitem()` calls.

**Code Implementation**
```c++
size_t index_to_offset(const std::vector<int32_t>& strides, 
                       const std::vector<int32_t>& indices, size_t base_offset) {
  size_t offset = base_offset;
  
  // Iterate over each dimension and compute the linear offset
  for (size_t dim = 0; dim < indices.size(); ++dim) {
    offset += indices[dim] * strides[dim];
  }
  
  return offset;
}

void IncrementIndices(std::vector<int32_t>& indices, const std::vector<int32_t>& shape) {
  for (int dim = shape.size() - 1; dim >= 0; --dim) {
    indices[dim]++;
    if (indices[dim] < shape[dim]) {
      break;
    }
    indices[dim] = 0;  // Reset and carry to the next dimension
  }
}

void Compact(const AlignedArray& a, AlignedArray* out, std::vector<int32_t> shape,
             std::vector<int32_t> strides, size_t offset) {
  /**
   * Compact an array in memory
   *
   * Args:
   *   a: non-compact representation of the array, given as input
   *   out: compact version of the array to be written
   *   shape: shapes of each dimension for a and out
   *   strides: strides of the *a* array (not out, which has compact strides)
   *   offset: offset of the *a* array (not out, which has zero offset, being compact)
   *
   * Returns:
   *  void (you need to modify out directly, rather than returning anything; this is true for all the
   *  function will implement here, so we won't repeat this note.)
   */
  /// BEGIN SOLUTION
  std::vector<int32_t> a_idx(shape.size(), 0);  // Initialize index vector for all dimensions

  for (size_t out_idx = 0; out_idx < out->size; out_idx++) {
    size_t a_offset = index_to_offset(strides, a_idx, offset);
    out->ptr[out_idx] = a.ptr[a_offset];
    IncrementIndices(a_idx, shape);
  }
  /// END SOLUTION
}
```
### Explanation of `Compact`
The `Compact` function's purpose is to rearrange the elements of a non-compact array (with potentially irregular strides or an offset) into a compact form, which means storing the array's elements sequentially in memory without any gaps or offsets. To illustrate this process, let's revisit the example you provided.

#### Example of Non-Compact and Compact Memory Layouts

Let's assume we have a 2D array with the following values (using placeholders `x` for the gaps):

#### Non-Compact Array in Memory (with gaps):

```python3
Memory Layout: [ 1, x, x, x, x, x, 2, 3, x, x, x, x, 4, 5, x, x, x, x, 6, 7, x, x, x, x, 8 ]
Addresses:      0000 0001 0002 0003 0004 0005 0006 0007 0008 0009 0010 0011 0012 0013 0014 0015 0016 0017 0018 0019 0020 0021 0022 0023 0024
```
This array has elements interleaved with gaps (`x`). The gaps might represent padding due to irregular strides, meaning that the distance between consecutive elements in the same row or column is not consistent.

#### Compact Array in Memory (after compacting):
```python3
Memory Layout: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ]
Addresses:      0100 0101 0102 0103 0104 0105 0106 0107
```
In the compact version, the array's elements are stored sequentially in memory, without any gaps, resulting in a compact, contiguous block.

#### Memory Addresses

-   **Non-Compact Array:**
    
    -   Let's say the first element `1` is stored at memory address `0000`.
    -   Due to irregular strides, the next element `2` is not at `0001`, but rather at `0006`.
    -   Similarly, the subsequent elements are at non-sequential addresses.
-   **Compact Array:**
    
    -   After compacting, the first element `1` might start at a new memory address, say `0100`.
    -   The elements `2`, `3`, and so on, will be stored at contiguous addresses `0101`, `0102`, and so on.

#### How `Compact` Function Works

```c++

cnt = 0;

for (size_t i = 0; i < shape[0]; i++)

for (size_t j = 0; j < shape[1]; j++)

for (size_t k = 0; k < shape[2]; k++)

out[strides[0]*i + strides[1]*j + strides[2]*k] = in[cnt++]; // or "= val;"

```

The `Compact` function iterates through the elements of the non-compact array, calculates the correct source address in the non-compact array using the provided strides and offset, and then writes these elements sequentially into the compact output array.

-   The loop over `i`, `j`, and `k` ensures that every element is visited based on the `shape` and `strides`.
-   The element in the compact array `out` is assigned by sequentially placing the elements from `in` according to the correct memory offsets calculated using `strides`.

-   `out` will use new memory. This new memory is allocated to hold the compacted version of the array, where elements are stored contiguously without any gaps.
-   The input array in this context represents a layout where the data is interspersed with gaps (`x`), which may be due to padding or other reasons. The output array will then be a compact version where all data elements are stored consecutively.

This process involves copying data from the non-compact source into the newly allocated compact destination, ensuring efficient access patterns and contiguous memory layout for further processing.

### Explaination of **References (`&`)** and **Constant (`const`)**

**References (`&`)**:

-   A reference in C++ is an alias for another variable. When you pass a variable by reference, you're allowing the function to operate directly on the original data, rather than a copy of it.
```c++
int x = 10;
int& ref = x; // ref is a reference to x
ref = 20;     // changes x to 20
```
**Constant (`const`)**:

-   `const` is used to declare something as constant, meaning its value cannot be modified after initialization. When used with a reference, it means the function cannot modify the referenced variable.
```c++
const int y = 10;  // y is a constant integer, cannot be modified
// y = 20;  // Error: you cannot change y because it's const
```
**Passing by Reference**:

-   When a function parameter is passed by reference, the function operates directly on the original data, not a copy.

```c++
void increment(int& num) {
    num++;  // This modifies the original variable
}

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    increment(a);
    // a is now 11
}
```

**Constant Reference (`const &`)**:

-   A constant reference is a reference that cannot be used to modify the object it refers to. It's useful for passing large objects to functions without copying them, while ensuring the function does not change the original object.

```c++
void increment(const int& num) {  // `num` is a const reference, cannot be modified
    num++;  // Error: you cannot modify `num` because it's const
}

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    increment(a);  // This will cause a compilation error such like error: increment of read-only reference ‘num’
}
```
### Explain `size_t `
`size_t` is an unsigned integer type in C and C++ that is used to represent the size of objects in bytes, as well as for indexing and looping purposes when dealing with sizes. It is the type returned by the `sizeof` operator and is defined in the standard library header `<stddef.h>` (or `<cstddef>` in C++).

Suppose you have an array of integers, and you want to calculate how much memory (in bytes) is required to store this array. You can use `sizeof` along with `size_t` to do this.
```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stddef.h>

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    size_t arr_size = sizeof(arr); // total size in bytes
    size_t elem_size = sizeof(arr[0]); // size of one element in bytes
    size_t num_elements = arr_size / elem_size; // number of elements in the array

    printf("Total size of array: %zu bytes\n", arr_size);
    printf("Size of one element: %zu bytes\n", elem_size);
    printf("Number of elements in the array: %zu\n", num_elements);

    return 0;
}

# Total size of array: 20 bytes
# Size of one element: 4 bytes
# Number of elements in the array: 5
```
```c++
int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
size_t arr_size = sizeof(arr);
```

`sizeof(arr)` returns the total size of the array in bytes. Since each `int` typically takes up 4 bytes (this can vary by platform), and there are 5 elements, `arr_size` would be `5 * 4 = 20` bytes.

### Explain AlignedArray
```c++
/**
 * This is a utility structure for maintaining an array aligned to ALIGNMENT boundaries in
 * memory.  This alignment should be at least TILE * ELEM_SIZE, though we make it even larger
 * here by default.
 */
struct AlignedArray {
  AlignedArray(const size_t size) {
    int ret = posix_memalign((void**)&ptr, ALIGNMENT, size * ELEM_SIZE);
    if (ret != 0) throw std::bad_alloc();
    this->size = size;
  }
  ~AlignedArray() { free(ptr); }
  size_t ptr_as_int() {return (size_t)ptr; }
  scalar_t* ptr;
  size_t size;
};
```
The `AlignedArray` structure is a custom C++ data structure designed to manage a dynamically allocated array with specific memory alignment requirements. This structure is particularly useful in performance-critical applications, such as scientific computing or systems programming, where aligned memory access can improve performance.

**Member Variables**:

-   **`scalar_t* ptr;`**:
    -   This is a pointer to the allocated memory block where the array elements are stored. The type `scalar_t` is defined as `typedef float scalar_t;`, meaning that `ptr` points to an array of `float` values.
-   **`size_t size;`**:
    -   This variable stores the number of elements in the array. It indicates how many `float` elements are stored in the memory block pointed to by `ptr`.

### Explain `void Compact(const AlignedArray& a, AlignedArray* out, std::vector<int32_t> shape,std::vector<int32_t> strides, size_t offset)`

-   **`const AlignedArray& a`**: This is a reference to the input array `a` that we want to compact. It is passed as a constant reference, meaning the function cannot modify this array.
-   **`AlignedArray* out`**: This is a pointer to the output array `out`, where the compacted version of `a` will be stored.
-   **`std::vector<int32_t> shape`**: A vector representing the shape (or dimensions) of the array `a`.
-   **`std::vector<int32_t> strides`**: A vector representing the strides of the array `a`. Strides are used to calculate the position of elements in memory.
-   **`size_t offset`**: An offset that specifies where the actual data for `a` starts within its allocated memory.

#### Difference Between `AlignedArray` and `std::vector`

-   **`AlignedArray`:**

    -   A custom structure designed to manage memory alignment, ensuring that the array's data is aligned in memory according to a specified boundary (e.g., 256 bytes).
    -   Used for optimized performance, especially in contexts where memory alignment is critical (e.g., SIMD operations, hardware optimizations).
    -   Memory allocation and deallocation are handled manually using `posix_memalign` and `free`.
    
-   **`std::vector`:**
    
    -   A standard template library (STL) container that manages dynamic arrays. It automatically handles memory allocation, deallocation, and resizing.
    -   Provides a contiguous memory layout but doesn't guarantee specific alignment unless explicitly requested.
    -   Offers many utilities like size management, iterators, and exception safety, which are not inherently provided by `AlignedArray`.
   
### Explain `std::vector<int32_t> a_idx(shape.size(), 0);`

#### 1. `std::vector<int32_t>`

-   `std::vector<int32_t>` is a C++ Standard Library container that represents a dynamic array. Unlike regular arrays, vectors can change their size dynamically, and they handle memory management automatically.
-   The `int32_t` type is a fixed-width integer type that guarantees the integer will be 32 bits. It's defined in the `<cstdint>` header.

#### 2. `(shape.size(), 0)`

-   `shape.size()` returns the number of elements in the `shape` vector. This tells us how many dimensions the shape of the array has.
-   The second argument, `0`, initializes all elements of the vector `a_idx` to `0`.

#### Example

Suppose `shape` is a vector representing the shape of a 3D array, say `[4, 3, 2]`:

-   `shape.size()` would return `3`, meaning the array has 3 dimensions.
-   `a_idx` would be a vector of size 3, initialized to `[0, 0, 0]`.

This vector `a_idx` is typically used to keep track of the current position within a multi-dimensional array as you iterate through it.

### Explain `out->size`

The expression `out->size` in C++ is used to access the `size` member of the object that the pointer `out` points to.

**`->` Operator**:

-   The `->` operator is used in C++ to access members (variables or functions) of an object through a pointer.
-   It is equivalent to dereference the pointer `out` to get the object it points to, and then access the `size` member of that object: `(*out).size`.

### Explaination of `index_to_offset`
```c++
size_t index_to_offset(const std::vector<int32_t>& strides, 
                       const std::vector<int32_t>& indices, size_t base_offset) {
  size_t offset = base_offset;
  // Iterate over each dimension and compute the linear offset
  for (size_t dim = 0; dim < indices.size(); ++dim) {
    offset += indices[dim] * strides[dim];
  }
  return offset;
}
```
This function converts a multi-dimensional index into a single-dimensional memory offset.

-   **Arguments**:
    
    -   `strides`: A vector representing the strides for each dimension in the array.
    -    `indices`: A vector representing the current multi-dimensional position in the array.
    -   `base_offset`: The starting offset in the array's memory block.

-   **What it does**:
    
    -   The function calculates the memory position corresponding to the given `indices`.
    -   It multiplies each element in `indices` by its corresponding stride, sums these values, and adds the initial `base_offset`.

#### Example:

For a 2D array with strides `[2, 1]` (assuming row-major order), and an index `[1, 1]`:

-   The offset would be `offset + (1 * 2) + (1 * 1) = base_offset + 2 + 1 = base_offset + 3`.

### Explaination of `IncrementIndices`
```c++
void IncrementIndices(std::vector<int32_t>& indices, const std::vector<int32_t>& shape) {
  for (int dim = shape.size() - 1; dim >= 0; --dim) {
    indices[dim]++;
    if (indices[dim] < shape[dim]) {
      break;
    }
    indices[dim] = 0;  // Reset and carry to the next dimension
  }
}
```


This function is used to increment an index vector that represents the current position within a multi-dimensional array, traversing through its elements in lexicographical order.

-   **Arguments**:
    
    -   `indices`: A reference to a vector that holds the current position in the array.
    -   `shape`: A vector that holds the size of each dimension in the array.
-   **What it does**:
    
    -   The function starts by incrementing the last element (corresponding to the last dimension) of the `indices` vector.
    -   If this increment exceeds the size of that dimension (i.e., `indices[dim] >= shape[dim]`), it resets the index for that dimension to `0` and carries the increment to the next higher dimension.
    -   This process continues until the increment is successful in a dimension (i.e., the incremented index is still valid, `indices[dim] < shape[dim]`), at which point the loop breaks.

- **Carry Mechanism**:

	-   The function mimics how numbers carry over in a multi-digit number system. When the index for a particular dimension reaches its limit, it resets to `0` and increments the next higher dimension, just like how carrying works in a number system when a digit reaches its maximum value (e.g., from 9 to 0 in decimal).

#### Example:

Consider a 2D array with shape `[3, 2]` (3 rows, 2 columns).

-   Start with `indices = [0, 0]`.
-   After the first call to `IncrementIndices`, `indices` becomes `[0, 1]` (incrementing the last dimension).
-   After the second call, `indices` becomes `[1, 0]` (the last dimension resets to 0, and the next dimension increments).
-   After several more calls, `indices` becomes `[2, 1]`.
-   At this point, all elements have been visited, and the loop in the `Compact` function would stop iterating. The `indices` will not reset to `[0, 0]` unless explicitly needed by additional logic outside this context.

### Explaination of `Compact`

This is the main function that compacts a non-contiguous array into a contiguous one.

-   **Arguments**:
    
    -   `a`: The input non-compact (potentially non-contiguous) array.
    -   `out`: The output array where the compacted (contiguous) version will be written.
    -   `shape`: The shape of the array.
    -   `strides`: The strides of the input array `a`, which define how many elements in memory need to be skipped to move along each dimension in `a`.
    -   `offset`: The base offset in the input array `a`, representing the starting position in the flattened memory.
    
-   **What it does**:

    -   The function initializes a vector `a_index` to `[0, 0, ..., 0]`, representing the starting multi-dimensional position in the input array `a`.
    -   It iterates over every element in the output array `out`. For each element:
        1.  **Calculate Offset**: It calculates the corresponding position (`a_offset`) in the input array `a` using `index_to_offset`.
        2.  **Copy Data**: It copies the value from `a.ptr[a_offset]` to `out->ptr[out_index]`.
        3.  **Increment Index**: It advances to the next index using `IncrementIndices`.


#### Summary:

-   **`IncrementIndices`**: Moves through each element of the array in a lexicographical order.
-   **`index_to_offset`**: Converts a multi-dimensional index into a linear memory offset.
-   **`Compact`**: Uses these helper functions to create a contiguous version of a potentially non-contiguous array, ensuring that the data is stored sequentially in memory.

### Explanation of `EwiseSetitem`

The `EwiseSetitem` function is responsible for setting the elements of a non-compact (potentially non-contiguous) array (`out`) using the values from a compact array (`a`). This is essentially the reverse process of the `Compact` function, where data from a contiguous array is written into a non-contiguous one.

#### Arguments:

-   **`a`**: A compact array whose elements will be written to `out`. Since it is compact, its elements are laid out sequentially in memory, and no strides are required to access its data.
-   **`out`**: A non-compact array where the elements of `a` will be written. The elements in `out` are stored non-contiguously in memory, so strides are needed to compute the correct offsets.
-   **`shape`**: A vector representing the shape of both `a` and `out`, which defines the size of each dimension in the arrays.
-   **`strides`**: A vector representing the strides of the non-contiguous `out` array. These strides help calculate the memory offset for each element in `out`, as its data is not laid out sequentially.
-   **`offset`**: The base offset in the non-contiguous `out` array, indicating where to start writing data from `a`.

#### What it does:

1.  **Initialize Index Vector**:
    -   A vector `out_index` is initialized to `[0, 0, ..., 0]`, representing the current multi-dimensional index in the non-contiguous `out` array.
2.  **Iterate Over `a`**:
    -   The function loops over every element in the compact array `a`. For each element:
        1.  **Calculate Offset**:
            -   The `index_to_offset` function is used to compute the memory offset in `out` for the current `out_index` based on the strides and offset. This tells the function where in `out` the corresponding element from `a` should be placed.
        2.  **Set Element**:
            -   The value from `a.ptr[a_idx]` (the current element in `a`) is written to the computed position in `out->ptr[out_offset]`.
        3.  **Increment Index**:
            -   The function calls `IncrementIndices` to advance `out_index` to the next multi-dimensional index, so the next element of `a` can be written into the appropriate position in `out`.

#### Summary:

-   **`IncrementIndices`**: Advances the multi-dimensional index in `out`, so the function can traverse all elements of the non-contiguous array.
-   **`index_to_offset`**: Converts the multi-dimensional index into a linear offset for accessing memory in the non-contiguous `out` array.
-   **`EwiseSetitem`**: Uses the values from the compact array `a` to set the elements in the non-contiguous array `out`, respecting the strides and offsets of `out`.

#### Example:

Consider `a` as a compact 2D array with shape `[3, 2]` and `out` as a non-compact array with the same shape but non-contiguous memory layout:

-   The function will loop through each element in `a` (stored contiguously), and for each element, it will compute where it should be written in `out` based on `out`'s strides and offset.
-   It uses `IncrementIndices` to move lexicographically through the elements of `out`, ensuring each element in `a` is placed correctly in `out`.

This function is crucial when working with non-contiguous arrays, as it ensures that data is written into the correct positions in memory, respecting the layout described by the strides and offset of the `out` array.

  /**

   *
   * Args:

### Explanation of `ScalarSetitem`

The `ScalarSetitem` function is used to set all elements of a non-contiguous array (`out`) to a specific scalar value (`val`). This function is useful when you want to assign a single value to a multi-dimensional array, even if the array's memory layout is non-contiguous.

#### Arguments:

-   **`size`**: The number of elements to be written in the `out` array. This value represents the total number of elements to write, which is equivalent to the product of the dimensions in the `shape`. It is passed directly for convenience.
-   **`val`**: The scalar value to be written to each element in the `out` array.
-   **`out`**: A non-compact array whose elements are to be updated with the scalar value. Since the array is non-contiguous in memory, strides and offset must be used to determine where each element is located.
-   **`shape`**: A vector that represents the shape of the `out` array, specifying the size of each dimension.
-   **`strides`**: A vector that represents the strides of the non-contiguous `out` array. Strides define how many memory positions to skip when moving along each dimension.
-   **`offset`**: The base offset in the `out` array, indicating where to start writing data.

#### What it does:

1.  **Initialize Index Vector**:
    
    -   A vector `out_index` is initialized to `[0, 0, ..., 0]`. This vector represents the starting multi-dimensional index in the `out` array, and it will be incremented throughout the function.
2.  **Iterate Over Elements**:
    
    -   The function loops over the total number of elements (`size`). For each iteration:
        1.  **Calculate Offset**:
            -   It uses `index_to_offset` to compute the memory offset for the current position in the non-contiguous `out` array. The offset is calculated based on the strides and the current multi-dimensional index (`out_index`), along with the provided base offset.
        2.  **Set Scalar Value**:
            -   The scalar value `val` is written to the memory position at `out->ptr[out_offset]`.
        3.  **Increment Index**:
            -   The multi-dimensional index (`out_index`) is incremented using `IncrementIndices` to move to the next element in the array.

#### Summary:

-   **`IncrementIndices`**: This function helps traverse the multi-dimensional index (`out_index`) in lexicographical order, moving through the entire array.
-   **`index_to_offset`**: This function converts the multi-dimensional index into a linear memory offset based on the strides and the base offset of the non-contiguous `out` array.
-   **`ScalarSetitem`**: This function writes a scalar value (`val`) to every element in the non-contiguous `out` array, making sure to respect the array's strides and offset to handle the non-contiguous memory layout correctly.

### Example:

Consider `out` as a non-contiguous 2D array with shape `[3, 2]`, strides `[2, 1]`, and an offset of `0`. The function will:

-   Loop through all `size = 6` elements of the array.
-   For each element, it calculates the correct memory location using the strides and current multi-dimensional index (`out_index`).
-   It writes the scalar value `val` to the calculated position in memory.
-   The index is incremented until all elements are set to the scalar value.

This function ensures that the scalar value is written correctly, even when the array's memory layout is non-contiguous.
