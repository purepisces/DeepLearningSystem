The key components you'll be working on include array operations in Python and low-level memory manipulations in C++ for efficient computation.

 For ndarray.py, it is based on Python's default array handling, which uses row-major order. In row-major order, the last index in the shape has the smallest stride, meaning elements of the last dimension are contiguous in memory.


when modified `ndarray_backend_cpu.cc`, each time you need to !make and see the results.



-   **`ndarray_backend_cuda.cu`**: This file contains code written in **CUDA C/C++**, which is a parallel computing platform and programming model created by NVIDIA. CUDA extends C/C++ to enable programmers to write code that runs on NVIDIA GPUs. The `.cu` extension indicates that the file contains CUDA-specific functions, and it includes both standard C/C++ code and CUDA-specific constructs for GPU programming, such as kernel functions and memory management for GPU devices.
    
-   **`ndarray_backend_cpu.cc`**: This file is written in **C++** and is designed to run on the CPU. The `.cc` extension is commonly used for C++ source files (though `.cpp` is also frequently used). This file contains functions that operate on arrays using the CPU's resources, without the parallelism or GPU-specific features of CUDA.
    

### Language Summary:

-   **`.cu` (ndarray_backend_cuda.cu)**: CUDA C/C++ for programming with GPUs.
-   **`.cc` (ndarray_backend_cpu.cc)**: Standard C++ code for CPU operations.
-   **`.py`**: Python, typically used to interface with the C++ or CUDA backends using Python bindings like PyBind11, allowing high-level Python code to call C++/CUDA functions.

-   **CUDA C/C++**: An extension of C and C++ developed by NVIDIA, adding GPU programming features. It enables you to write code that runs on GPUs using **CUDA** (Compute Unified Device Architecture). CUDA C/C++ includes specific syntax and libraries for GPU programming, such as managing threads, grids, blocks, and memory on the GPU.
