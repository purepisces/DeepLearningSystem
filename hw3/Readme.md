The key components you'll be working on include array operations in Python and low-level memory manipulations in C++ for efficient computation.

 For ndarray.py, it is based on Python's default array handling, which uses row-major order. In row-major order, the last index in the shape has the smallest stride, meaning elements of the last dimension are contiguous in memory.
